- Pereptron - single layer neural network - used in solving binary classifiers.
- single layer neural netwok has - 1 hidden layer that is only one neuron.
- when inputs are connected to the hidden layers we, initialize the weights.- random
- hidden layer has z-score = summation of inputs multiplied by the weights wixi +b
- total = step 1 - zscore, step 2 - take activation function and that to z score.
- so the value is now between 0 and 1.
- Perceptron is linear classifier , it separtes the points.- BC
- Finds best fit line to solve classification problem.

#### why we need multi layer neural network ?

- perceptron wont be able to solve such complex problems.
- which are not linearly separable.
